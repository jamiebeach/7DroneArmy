Sora sat alone at a table for two. A grande Pike roast steaming before her in a temperature moderating ceramic mug. Chatter between friends at the tables to the right. A man talking aloud to nobody, but to somebody to the left.

She looked ahead but focused on the mixed reality virtual stage in front of her. On it, the real-time 3d visuals from her micro drone several hundred meters directly above. The reconstructed models from within the building looked like little chess pieces before her. Glitches in their reconstruction caused by packet loss during transmission and making the 3d models deform into otherworldly shapes. Labels would appear and disappear, trying to convey all the data it was collecting. It was clear, however, that the office was full. Any non-discrete action word certainly cause mayhem.

Suddenly the rendering zoomed in and an indicator aligned over a particular model in an office on the north eastern side of the building. Sora caught herself holding her breath as the accuracy indicator increased and the words appeared superimposed over her view. 

Target acquired. Verified near 90% certainty. Engaging now.
