Despite the heavy breeze at the height and its light frame, the micro quadcopter maintained precise altitude and near perfect distance from the high rise. 93 stories up, a thick fog had enveloped the city but it was no match for the drone's powerful ultrasonic imaging array. 

Radio waves burst through the haze, glass and metal and bounced back to the tiny machine, turning into data points. Vertices and edges manifested in high speed memory to high resolution 3d models. Graphene based transistors computing motion and performing body and object identification. Terabytes of footage recorded onto excited atoms and beamed down to a screen on the ground.

The drone slowly moved around the building unseen. A cat stalking prey. It kept a distance such that it was nearly transparent to anyone gazing mindlessly out their office window.

Using hyper sensitive audio capture, it took in all sounds within, transcribing the conversations on multiple floors and attempting to identify a particular vocal pattern with it's highly advanced noise cancellation and speech recognition systems.

It came to a halt and maintained a precise  stalled position while it dialed into the location of a particular person inside. Billions of calculations per second running through a deep neural network, identifying that this individual was likely the target, with 85% accuracy.

Subroutines began executing and notification events were pushed out through encrypted channels to the receiver. The accuracy of the prediction increased slightly, passing the threshold between innocuous observer and viscous hunter. 

The whir of the tiny spinning engine blades went from ultra quiet to ultra high pitch as it suddenly burst into forward motion at an extremely high velocity, aiming itself through the window, the multiple interior walls and into the office of the target.
