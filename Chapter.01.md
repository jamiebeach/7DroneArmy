The sound of the gravel under his boot seemed to echo between the buildings along the street. James flinched. It was too quiet. He could feel a pair of eyes on him. He knew there was someone or something watching him slowly make his way towards the check point. Their presence was fairly obvious since the earlier mech battle.

The HUD indicated his energy levels were less than suboptimal and his blaster had just a single shot left. He calculated that it was less that 800 meters between where he stood and the building in front of him. Around it, animated rings glowing blue like spinning bangels, indicating reprieve, bags of coins and a level up. He was close. He could make it.

Along the sides of the street, empty shops and pubs. Main St USA. Only with blown out windows and rubble everywhere. Burnt out vehicles, drones and dust. Like a B grade zombie thriller with empty streets and brain eating trouble around every corner. It was an aftermath one would expect to have resulted from a nuclear bomb with a splash of pandemic.

James took another step, his grip tightening on the plasma blaster - a replica of a real Crono Group assult weapon. Sweat dripped from his brow and caressed his cheek. The sun sat in its perpetual state of either setting or rising. He wasn't sure. It always seemed to hover in just the right spot casting deep shadows and painting everything in a golden orange. Here, time was irrelevant.

Another step. How long have I been here? Have I even eaten anything recently? Holy shit, I dont think I've had anything to eat since last night's Hoggen Daz.

A sudden shuffle from behind a mangled Tesla. James turned quickly and raised the blaster, the sound of excited plasma crackling like hot oil. An indicator of someone, or something, appeared on his HUD, painting a dot near the car.

The dot moved quickly and was suddenly a stones throw away where it paused. 

"Good grief, I've seen cat vomit more appealing" renarked James. If it was a human character, it was definitely worse for wear. Maybe 4 feet tall. His hair in the thickest of long, dirty dreadlocks. His face was smeared with dirt. He clearly never showered. His eyes were abnormally large, bulging out of the sockets as if trying to be free of the decrepit body. His clothes very well worn. And he walked barefoot. Hard to tell but seemed to be missing some toes.

"I'm an NPC." He replied, followed by a fit of wretched coughing. "They call me Andy the Destroyer." At that, James felt a grin forming on his face. Was that a joke?

"Go ahead and laugh, Player 1. But I will destroy you now. Take your weapons and coins."

James heard the LOL emoji pop from his head and took aim with the plasma blaster. At that, a massive dark matter cannon appeared on the NPC's shoulders. James didn't feel a thing as the cannon unleashed an energy that possibly could destroy a world. Andy's name was appropriate perhaps, after all.

It all went black. The sound of digital fuzz slowing to single blips. Sine wave frequencies crushed under a universe imploding.

Player 1, game over.

Back to 0 coins and no weapons, James stepped out of his VR box. His head was swimming as was typical after lengthy virtual reality session. Getting back to the real was so difficult with such immersive tech. There were some moments that James could hardly tell where he was. 

He was starving and his throat incredibly hoarse. He noted to himself the need to invest in an auto-feeder and hydration system as part of his VR setup.

James almost envied those that had the guts to go all in and decide to live in VR forever removing themselves from body. Their brains artificially supported in facilities with their 5 9's of guaranteed brain support uptime. Although the accident earlier in the year at the Ohio VR facility that left tens of thousands of brains without oxygen for several hours certainly impacted his perspective on that.

He switched on his AR system and the otherwise drab and empty living room filled with color and action. The walls, plain white a moment ago now plastered with graphics and animation. The news channel over to his left, near the seating area appeared and an anchor blabbed on about the new efforts and struggles to continue worldwide o2 supplementation. The ceiling filled with a blue sky and fluffy clouds. He could almost feel the heat from the artificial sun.

James took a deep breath, brushed his hand through his jet black hair and turned towards the many screens now floating in front of him. On the screens appeared lines and graphs. Green and red candles showing fluctuating prices of crypto currencies. Notifications popping up indicating possible buy and sell opportunities.

The market had clearly been hot while he was gone. He missed a number of amazing opportunities. Like he usually did. And his portfolio was down. Like usual.

"Shit. I'm losing everywhere."
